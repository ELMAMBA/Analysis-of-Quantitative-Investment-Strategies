*Before running the code:*
 
 - Create a folder in your Google Drive with the name "_Data_"
 
 - Download the data inside the "Data" folder
 
 - Transfer the data to folder you just created in the Google Drive
 
 - Download the notebook named "Returns", and run it on the Google Colab (this is important as the references to the data are connected with Google Drive)
 
 To check the Performance Statistics, and plots, download the notebooks inside the respective folders
 
 Note: To download a notebook, you have to select it, select the option "Raw" next to the "Blame" button, and save it as a ipynb file. Then you can upload it in your Google Colab environment and work from there.
 
 **Abstract**
 
 Momentum is one of the most studied anomalies in the literature. For decades it delivered significant excess returns, however lately it has been underperforming. In this work I show that by combining a dual momentum strategy with risk parity weighting and volatility scaling, a considerable amount of the momentum strategies downfalls can be solved, while increasing the Sharpe Ratio almost five times in comparison with the default momentum strategy, and dramatically reducing the tail risk.
