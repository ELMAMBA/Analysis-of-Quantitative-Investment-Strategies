**Abstract**

This work project describes the strategy and results of four independently developed investment strategies. The strategies focus on value and momentum, ETF mispricing, enhanced momentum, and asset switching. The strategies are carried out in periods between 1998 and 2021. Three of the four strategies focus on the U.S. market whereas one is focused on the European market. Due to fundamental differences in their composition and execution, the strategies yield different risk and return profiles; all but one strategy underperform equity and fixed-income securities benchmark indexes. Subsequent portfolio optimization and allocation methods, with the four individual strategies as assets, improve the risk-adjusted return of a combined portfolio in excess of the benchmark indexes. However, the significance of these improved portfolio results is limited due to inconsistent treatment of transaction costs and the small sample period.
