 Abstract
 
 It is well-known in the financial world that investors often turn to gold as a “safe haven” during times of adverse market conditions. This study explores a rotational 
 strategy that involves switching between gold and the market in an attempt to try to time the latter and minimize losses during these periods. Findings suggest that 
 the effectiveness of this strategy largely varies depending on the specific macroeconomic conjuncture, showing promising results during the Covid-19 Crisis of 2020, 
 but less so during the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09.
